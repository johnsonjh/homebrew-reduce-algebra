# REDUCE for Homebrew

* A [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) for
  [**REDUCE**](https://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/), the portable
  general-purpose computer algebra system.

## Overview

* [**REDUCE**](https://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/) is a freely available
  open source interactive system for general algebraic computations, of
  interest to mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. It can be used
  interactively for simple calculations, but also provides a flexible and
  expressive user programming language.

* The development of the [**REDUCE**](https://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/)
  computer algebra system was started in the 1960's by Anthony C. Hearn
  and further developed by Arthur C. Norman and others. Since then,
  many scientists from all over the world have contributed to its
  development â€” [**REDUCE**](https://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/) has a
  long and distinguished place in the history of computer algebra systems.

## Availability

* Only **macOS** systems are supported at this time.
